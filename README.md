# Student Performance Early Warning System

## Overview
The Student Performance Early Warning System is a Machine Learning–based project designed to identify students who are at academic risk at an early stage.  
The system helps educators and institutions take timely intervention actions to improve student outcomes.

## Problem Statement
Many students face academic failure because performance issues are identified too late.  
This project aims to predict student risk levels early using historical academic and demographic data, enabling proactive support.

## Objectives
- Analyze student academic performance data  
- Identify students who are at risk of poor performance  
- Classify students into different risk levels  
- Build a reliable Machine Learning model for prediction  

## Dataset
- Source: Public Student Performance Dataset (UCI / Kaggle)
- The dataset includes:
  - Student demographics
  - Study habits
  - Parental education
  - Past academic performance
  - Internal and final exam scores

## Methodology
1. Data collection and understanding  
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature selection and encoding  
5. Train–test split  
6. Model training using Machine Learning algorithms  
7. Model evaluation and interpretation  

## Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm Used:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Reason for Selection:**
  - Handles multiple features efficiently  
  - Provides good accuracy  
  - Reduces overfitting  
  - Offers feature importance insights  

## Output
The system classifies students into three categories:
- **Safe**
- **At Risk**
- **High Risk**

These predictions help in identifying students who require academic support.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Results
- The model achieves good prediction accuracy  
- Internal exam scores and study time are key factors influencing performance  
- Feature importance analysis provides insights into academic risk factors  

## Future Scope
- Deployment as a web application using Streamlit  
- Integration with real-time attendance systems  
- Automated alerts for faculty and students  
- Inclusion of behavioral and LMS data
