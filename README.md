Student Performance Early Warning System
Overview
This project is a Machine Learning–based Early Warning System designed to identify students who are at academic risk.
The model helps educators take early intervention actions to improve student outcomes.

Problem Statement
Many students fail or drop out due to late identification of academic difficulties.
This system predicts student risk levels using historical academic and demographic data.
